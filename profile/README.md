<h2 align>About us</h2>
Kyaliko is a small devteam created/owned by <a href="https://github.com/hi-doki">@Hi-Doki</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mallowo">@astromal</a>

Kyaliko creates open-source modern-styled applications because console apps are boring ;)

We want people to expand their programming knowledge and be more confident while coding, which is why
you can get coding tips and lessons from us anytime you want at <a href="mailto:talk@kyaliko.com">talk@kyaliko.com</a>

`please note that we will only help with C#, JS or PY`
